    "Utility is a vital concept for many of the maximization problems we will be approaching in the setting of finance. Of course, the basic economic definition of utility is the numerical value provided to the user of a utility function for some given input level. In our setting, we will often be converting money ($) to utility. This will help us to capture concepts that exist in the real world of our problems, such as risk-aversion. Largely, we will be working with concave utility functions - the marginal value of money decreases as our total amount of money increases. Intuitively, this causes us to be risk averse - losing money hurts more than gaining money, and we definitely want to avoid low nominal numbers of money."
